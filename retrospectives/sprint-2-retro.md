# Sprint 2 Retrospective

## What Worked Well
During Sprint 2, the team successfully completed the integration of the frontend and backend systems, establishing full communication between the Flutter interface and the Java-based backend. This milestone enabled end-to-end functionality across key features of the application. Additionally, the chatbot feature was fully developed and integrated, enhancing user interaction and engagement within the app. The team also created comprehensive test cases and executed all tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the system. These achievements mark a significant step toward a fully functional product ready for user validation.

## What Needs Improvement
While the integration and chatbot development were successfully completed, the sprint revealed the need for improved documentation and coordination during the testing phase. Some minor inconsistencies were identified between the implemented features and the original design specifications, which required additional clarification between frontend, backend, and QA teams. Enhancing documentation and maintaining tighter communication during testing and feature validation will help streamline future sprints and minimize rework.

## How Effective the AI Tools Were in Supporting Development
AI tools continued to be highly effective in Sprint 2. They played a major role in automating code generation for API integrations, debugging backend logic, and optimizing frontend responses during chatbot implementation. Overall, AI tools contributed to faster development cycles and more consistent code quality across the integrated system.

## How We Managed Our Git Workflow and Collaboration
The team maintained a disciplined Git workflow, using feature branches for each major task such as chatbot implementation, API integration, and testing setup. Pull requests and peer reviews remained central to the collaboration process, ensuring high-quality code merges into the main branch. Regular stand-up meetings and sprint syncs further supported clear communication and task alignment, allowing the team to stay on track with sprint objectives and deliverables.
