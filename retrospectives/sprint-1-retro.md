# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## What Worked Well
During Sprint 1, the UI/UX team successfully completed the entire user interface design for the application using Figma. The team focused on creating a consistent visual style, clear navigation flow, and user-friendly layouts that align with the project’s goals and core scenarios. By finalizing the full set of screens and design components, the UI/UX team provided a strong foundation for frontend development in upcoming sprints. The collaborative design process in Figma also enabled effective feedback and iteration, ensuring that the final UI reflects both functionality and user experience priorities.

## What Needs Improvement
Although the authentication endpoints were completed as part of backend development, the integration between the frontend and backend was not fully achieved in this sprint. The main interface for user interactions, such as swiping left or right to find a suitable study buddy, was completed in Flutter; however, the connection between the two systems (frontend and backend) remains pending. Improving the coordination between backend and frontend integration will be a key focus for the next sprint.

## How Effective the AI Tools Were in Supporting Development
AI tools, particularly GitHub Copilot, proved to be highly effective throughout the sprint. They significantly supported both backend and frontend development by assisting in code generation, providing relevant code suggestions, and enhancing productivity during implementation. Additionally, the AI tools contributed to smoother code reviews by suggesting improvements and ensuring coding standards were maintained.

## How We Managed Our Git Workflow and Collaboration
The team followed a structured Git workflow to maintain organized and collaborative development. Feature branches were created for different modules, and pull requests were used for code reviews before merging into the main branch. This process encouraged peer review, reduced merge conflicts, and improved overall code quality. Collaboration was also facilitated through regular updates and communication within the team, ensuring everyone stayed aligned with sprint goals and progress.
